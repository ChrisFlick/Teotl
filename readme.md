# Teotl

Teotl is a turn based competitive game; both players chose their elemental and have them battle each other. Turns are taken simultaneously; The player that wins has each battle has it's ability go off which strengthens your elementals for the next turn. The game plays out like a series of rock paper scissors matches, the arrows on the pentacle show which elemental is strong against it's opponent.
